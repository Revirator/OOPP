This code of conduct is created by us aiming to:

- Agree upon communication/collaboration arrangements to avoid problems caused by cultural differences.
- Make communication and collaboration as efficient as possible.

Mutual goal of this OOP project:
Build a working application that everyone is satisfied about. We will invest as much in the application that time allows us to.

Communication

* Main communication via WhatsApp OOPP group 43.


* Main application files can be found in GitLab, other (organizational) assignment files are stored in Teams.


* Thursday afternoons should be kept free for potential meetings in Teams.


* Everyone available on WhatsApp during lab hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays (8:45 - 17:45).


* Every member keeps track of issues assigned to him/her on GitLab Issues (deadlines, close Issue when done).


* Without a valid reason, being 5 minutes late in meetings is fine.


* Every weekly meeting reflect for 2-3 min. if communication has failed somewhere.
  - Code of Conduct violated? Discuss this during the meeting. When nothing improves, reach out to TA.


Collaboration


* On Tuesdays and Thursdays during lab hours (8:45 - 17:45) all members work on his/her tasks individually. Questions to TA can be asked in Mattermost, questions to other members in WhatsApp.


* All important decisions should be made based on consensus.


* Divide the tasks equally between all the members and adhere to them.
  - If one is not able to finish a task in time, be honest about it and inform the others.

* Make one person in charge of planning and taking meeting notes - Nadine.


* Every week, the meeting leader/chair, who makes sure all relevant topics are covered, rotates. (in the order: Senne - Pavel - Bora - Emke - Nadine - Denis)
