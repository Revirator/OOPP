This code of conduct is created by us aiming to:

- Agree upon communication/collaboration arrangements to avoid problems caused by cultural differences.
- Make communication and collaboration as efficient as possible.

Code of Conduct violated by one of the members?
- This will be addressed during our weekly Thursday meeting.
- This person should explain himself and propose a plan/ideas on how he will prevent this in the future from happening again. This person is expected to go over this Code of Conduct and reflect for himself where it exactly went wrong. If he thinks modifications should be made to this document, he can propose this as well, so we can collectively adapt our Code of Conduct.
- When nothing improves, the TA will be reported to via Mattermost.

###

Every weekly Thursday meeting ends by collectively reflecting for 5 min. if communication has failed somewhere or modifications must be made to this Code of Conduct.
This will be decided based on the following questions that we will discuss:
- Does this Code of Conduct contain points that not every member agrees upon any longer?
- Does this Code of Conduct contain incorrect information?
- Does this Code of Conduct contain points that can be described more elaborately?
- Are there new arrangements required that were not part of this document yet?

If we together decide modifications are necessary, each member is allowed to come up with new ideas/suggestions to update this document.


###

Mutual goal of this OOP project:
Build a working application that everyone is satisfied about. We will invest as much in the application that time allows us to.

Communication

* Main communication via WhatsApp OOPP group 43.


* Main application files can be found in GitLab, other (organizational) assignment files are stored in Teams.


* Thursday afternoons should be kept free for potential meetings in Teams.


* Everyone available on WhatsApp during lab hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays (8:45 - 17:45).


* Every member keeps track of issues assigned to him/her on GitLab Issues (deadlines, close Issue when done).


* Without a valid reason, being 5 minutes late in meetings is fine.


* All questions to be asked to TA, may be added to the file “MEETING NOTES”. For technical questions, reach out to technical TAs via Mattermost.


* When approving MRs, we leave appropriate comments (showing that you have understood the code).


* GitLab Issue descriptions follow a specific format that we agreed upon. (see examples in GitLab)


Collaboration


* On Tuesdays and Thursdays during lab hours (8:45 - 17:45) all members work on his/her tasks individually. Questions to TA can be asked in Mattermost, questions to other members in WhatsApp.


* All important decisions should be made based on consensus.


* Divide the tasks equally between all the members and adhere to them.
  - If one is not able to finish a task in time, be honest about it and inform the others.


* Make one person in charge of planning and taking meeting notes - Nadine.


* Every week, the meeting leader/chair, who makes sure all relevant topics are covered, rotates. (in the order: Senne - Pavel - Bora - Emke - Nadine - Denis)


* In our teams file “MEETING NOTES”, everyone may add ideas on what topics to discuss.


* Every sprint runs from Tuesday in week X until Tuesday in week X+1.


* Each member pushes his/her commits, belonging to a feature assigned to him/her, at the latest on Sunday, allowing others to have sufficient time to review code.


* Each Tuesday, we merge all feature branches into development_branch, as well as development_branch into master. Before this day, all commits must be adequately reviewed by at least 2 members, who then accept the MR.
